plan:

find R packages to do local linear smoothing: locfit
CV/GCV: GCV can be done just by using gcv with a proper list of bandwidths.
CV should be the same.

GCV: I'm not sure how to get the gcv of a subset of observations points
(e.g. the diagonal elements in the covariance matrix). 
Also, the bandwidth choice for matlab pc_covE (which smooths the diagonal
elements and get the sigma estimate) does not look reasonable, as
it uses just the bandwidth choice for the covariance itself, ignoring the rotation.

We should add an option 'truncTo' such that we truncate the interval to what
we want to analyze. Then in the truncated region points will be more
abundant. This also may help reduce boundary effect as we make use of the
points outside of the truncation region.

I see no rotation code in matlab PCA or mullwls.
