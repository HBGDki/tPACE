Write convertPhiMu

plan:
Change the implementation of lwls1d and lwls2d. Do not use locfit.

I don't know what the GCV implementation is in the matlab version. ASK Hans.

We should add an option 'truncTo' such that we truncate the interval to what
we want to analyze. Then in the truncated region points will be more
abundant. This also may help reduce boundary effect as we make use of the
points outside of the truncation region.

For dataset with large number observations we are better-off storing the count data rather than the unbinned raw covariance.

What is maxk in locfit? How to set it?
We implement up to 1024 grid points, for example.

rotateLwls2d: Use the correct (described) method in Yao 2005, rather than following the matlab/formula in Yao 2005.

 
Why grid1 in SetOptions?
