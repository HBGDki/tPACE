Write convertPhiMu

plan:
Change the implementation of lwls1d and lwls2d. Do not use locfit.
What is shrink?

I don't know what the GCV implementation is in the matlab version. ASK Hans.

What is maxk in locfit? How to set it?
We implement up to 1024 grid points, for example.

rotateLwls2d: Use the correct (described) method in Yao 2005, rather than following the matlab/formula in Yao 2005.

We still need to modify the FVE options.

Why grid1 in SetOptions?
Regular case and RegularWM: use matrix, since we need to implement crosssectional.

To Hao:
Implement bin count for pc_covE

Add a crosssectional option.
